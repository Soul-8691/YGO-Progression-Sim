New session:
Okay, please construct an initial trunk. What cards would you like to add?

Great! Next, construct initial packs you can open once you win a duel. What cards do you want to be in the packs?

Good; now, let's set the card rarities.

Great. Now, let's choose what cards are available to buy with Duelist Points at the start of the game.

Awesome. Now, time to set the prices.

Alright, now that you've set the initial game variables, please go through the process again, creating unlockable packs and cards to buy for when you've progressed to a certain point, either through beating the same duelist a certain number of times, acheiving victory in a certain way a certain number of times, acheiving a win streak of a certain length, etc. Make sure to assign tags to each pack and card with the unlock condition.

Perfect! Now, assign yourself a number of Duelist Points for the start of the game.

Great; now, what opponents will you face, what are their decks, and how many Duelist Points will they give upon defeat? Enter cards here.

Purrfect. Would you like to specify any ways of earning extra Duelist Points? Enter them here.

Cool. Also, how many cards do you want to wager per duel? Select a number from 0 to 5.

Great. Do you want to lose Duelist Points upon loss? If so, set the number of points to lose.

Awesome, dude. With that, you are ready to begin your card collection progression sim!
